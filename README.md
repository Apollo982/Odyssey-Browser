# _EoL for Odyssey_
_As of May 5th, 2024, Odyssey Browser has been discontinued. I plan to make another browser eventually, but not under the Odyssey name. Truth be told, this was actually just made in a no-code app maker. I had no idea what I was doing. Anyways, this is essentially just a reskined version of Lightning Browser by @anthonycr_

Odyssey Browser is a sleek, simple, and secure web browser for android.

With tabs like a computer, yet the functionality of mobile browser, it is has something for everyone! Keep your data private with our built in user agent switcher, remember
where you left off with the history widget, and customize (almost) everything to your heart's content!
